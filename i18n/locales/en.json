Customer information is encrypted to ensure privacy. On the admin side, an intuitive CRM was developed for Lead tracking, with a multi-level role system that ensures confidentiality. An innovative search method was implemented to manage encrypted data efficiently.\n\nThe application also includes endpoints to receive Leads from various external applications, centralizing motorcycle data and simplifying statistical analysis.\n\nThe system was built with an extensible structure to easily support future functionality additions.",
