      "long_description": "Application that manages Groups and Dealers, centralizing information such as contacts, social media, addresses, schedules, etc. The platform allows creating websites for each Group based on its domain, with options to manage both general and group-specific banners, as well as add promotions.\n\nThis main site has a landing page, customizable banners, a product list, a map of the group's branches, among other views.\n\nThe site allows potential customers to generate leads for specific products. The client's data is stored encrypted to protect their privacy. On the admin side, an intuitive CRM was created to follow up on leads, using a multi-level role system to ensure confidentiality. An innovative method for searching leads was applied, which was challenging due to encrypted data management.\n\nThe app also has endpoints to generate leads from various applications, centralizing all motorcycle data and simplifying statistical analysis.\n\nThe application was built with a scalable structure to easily support future feature additions.",
