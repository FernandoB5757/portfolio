      "long_description": "Application that manages Groups and Dealers, centralizing their information such as contacts, social networks, addresses, schedules, etc. The platform allows the generation of websites for each Group based on their domain, with options to manage banners (both general and group-specific), and add promotions.\n\nEach main site has its own Landing Page, banners, a model/product list, and a map of group branches, among other views.\n\nThe main site allows potential customers to create Leads for specific products. Customer information is encrypted to ensure privacy. On the admin side, an intuitive CRM was developed for Lead tracking, with a multi-level role system that ensures confidentiality. An innovative search method was implemented to manage encrypted data efficiently.\n\nThe application also includes endpoints to receive Leads from various external applications, centralizing motorcycle data and simplifying statistical analysis.\n\nThe system was built with an extensible structure to easily support future functionality additions.",
