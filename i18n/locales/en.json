      "title": "MIMO - Motorcycles",
      "description": "Management platform for motorcycle dealerships",
      "long_description": "Application that manages Groups and Dealers, centralizing their information such as contacts, social networks, addresses, schedules, etc. The platform allows the generation of websites for each Group based on their domain, with options to manage banners (both general and group-specific), and add promotions.\n\nEach main site has its own Landing Page, banners, a model/product list, and a map of group branches, among other views.\n\nThe main site allows potential customers to create Leads for specific products. Customer information is encrypted to ensure privacy. On the admin side, an intuitive CRM was developed for Lead tracking, with a multi-level role system that ensures confidentiality. An innovative search method was implemented to manage encrypted data efficiently.\n\nThe application also includes endpoints to receive Leads from various external applications, centralizing motorcycle data and simplifying statistical analysis.\n\nThe system was built with an extensible structure to easily support future functionality additions.",
      "contribution": "I participated in the creation of the application from its initial phase, from the analysis for the implementation of the application to its actual implementation, including the deployment to production. During the entire development process, I made decisions, managed resources, and handled problem analysis and resolution.\n\nOn the technical side, what I can highlight is the implementation of a solid foundation using design patterns such as the Repository Pattern and the Decorator Pattern, along with the use of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and VOs (Value Objects). This made it possible to establish a scalable and easy-to-maintain structure as the project grew.\n\nI also implemented Laravel Scout to improve searches within the admin panel, especially in the leads module, using Meilisearch as the driver. I configured the service and deployed it directly to the server.\n\nCurrently, I continue to maintain the application for optimization and improvement, creating new modules, such as building algorithms to automate the site."

      "contribution": "Among my contributions, I highlight the integration with SAP, which was a new and intensive challenge for me. It involved a direct connection using XML and RAW queries to the database. This required a significant amount of research to understand and implement everything necessary to achieve a working connection with SAP.\nOn the other hand, I worked on the creation of a package to handle the shopping cart, as well as the full implementation of the checkout process.\n\nThis was my first real experience with an e-commerce project, and I learned a lot about what it takes to build an online store from scratch. I’m currently still maintaining the application, improving modules, performing optimizations, and I also developed a new package to support the integration of the new payment method with Mercado Pago."
